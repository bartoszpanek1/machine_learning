# Machine Learning
Implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch.

## Installation

I'm using the package manager [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

## Usage
Each file in this repository corresponds to a different ML algorithm.
Run "main.py" in the selected folder to execute the algorithm and see its visualizations.
